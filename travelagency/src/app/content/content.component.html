    With the growing globalisation, travelling has gained importance for self-exploration, cultural exchange, and learning. However, even though travelling brings about many benefits, it accounts for 8% of global carbon emissions. Considering its growth,
    the percentage can rise every year. Moreover, unmindful travelling practices result in local businesses and communities facing problems. <br><br> Therefore, a new way of travelling has been brought to life; green travelling. But what exactly is
    green travelling? Sustainable tourism (ecotourism or even green travelling) consists of making simple choices to reduce its negative impact on a given destination. With its increasing popularity, another question occurs - how can one practice green
    travelling? Green travelling can be considered as an individual's responsibility to travel by giving back to nature and the local community of the target destination. <br><br> When travelling, the first issue is the choice of transportation. Although
    flying is usually the fastest and the cheapest option, it is an unsustainable way of travelling. To green travel, the first thing you can do is to avoid domestic flights in the first place. If you are travelling within Europe, it is best to use the
    train to transport. If you do not have such an option or you are travelling overseas, try to use direct flights as the takeoffs and landings create most of an aeroplaneâ€™s carbon emissions. You can also use airlines that offer carbon offset programs
    for a greener journey. In terms of getting around once you're at your destination, try to visit places by using an electric car, a bike, a scooter, or even better: on foot.</p>
